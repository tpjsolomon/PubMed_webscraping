# PubMed_webscraping
This repository contains Python scripts for streamlining your research process. 
The scripts automatically extract metadata from PubMed to create a list of hits that includes the paper titles and weblinks to the PubMed entry and full-text versions of the articles (DOI link and sci-hub link).
